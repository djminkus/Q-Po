PLAN
===
 * Robert examines game logic in ~/js/qpo03.js and makes bombs work perfectly. (In version 0.3, bombs mostly work but sometimes fail to explode.)
 * David creates a tutorial sequence for first-time players. 
 * Tyler Steele coming on board? (Database)
 * Josh Young coming on board? (Server)

## For Robert
 * To look at game logic, go to js/qpo03.js and examine the startGame() and nextTurn() functions
 * To test, clone the repo and open index.html in Chrome or any browser
 * The main menu is defined in js/menuScreen.js

## Vision
 * A simple but competitive javascript game that can be played in any modern browser, mobile or desktop
 * Monetized at launch
 * Tiered ranking system yielding close, fun matches for players of all skills
 * Zero-latency online play
 * Designed to foster a tournament community

## Agenda
 * implement server and enable PVP (Josh?)
 * user login system (use google/facebook/twitter accounts if possible) (Tyler?)
 * design and implement ranking system
